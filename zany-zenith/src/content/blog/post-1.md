## 🚀 Built-In Tools, No Plugin Overload  
With WordPress, you often rely on multiple plugins for SEO, forms, security, analytics, and more. HubSpot CMS offers all of this *out of the box*—from powerful SEO recommendations and A/B testing to smart content and CRM integration. That means less time patching things together, and more time focusing on growth.

## 🔒 Security Without the Headaches  
WordPress sites need constant updates, security plugins, and hosting management. HubSpot CMS is fully managed, with automatic updates, enterprise-grade security, and a built-in CDN—no third-party plugins required.

## ⚡ Speed & Performance  
HubSpot websites are lightning fast by default. No need to worry about caching plugins or image optimization. It’s already taken care of, and you get performance insights right in your dashboard.

## 👩‍💻 Marketer + Developer Friendly  
While WordPress often requires developers to build and maintain features, HubSpot’s drag-and-drop editing, theme system, and custom modules strike the perfect balance. Marketers can make updates without code, and developers still have full flexibility under the hood.

## 🤝 Natively Connected to the HubSpot CRM  
Unlike WordPress, where integrating with a CRM can be clunky or expensive, HubSpot CMS is deeply integrated with the HubSpot CRM—so every pageview, form submission, and CTA click is automatically tracked and usable for automation and personalization.
